## Adopt

Try adopting a pet on [Petful][site]! You can adopt a cat or a dog. When you go to the adoption page, you will only be shown a cat and dog that have been in the shelter the longest. You will also see a list of people in line. Enter your name to be added to the end of the line. When it is your turn, you can adopt a pet by clicking the button "Adopt" under the pet you want to adopt.
